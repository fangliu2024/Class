# Class project

 - We want to create a complex number
 - We can do this with classes, also search up Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
 - We can create a complex number now by using mynumber = Complex(1,2), I also added a show function. mynumber.show()

 1. Make more functions for the complex number class to include addition(), subtraction(), division() and exponential()
 2. Make the real and imaginary variables private, and provide methods (functions) to access them. This is called Encapsulation.
 2. Change the code so I can also use the symbols: +, -, /, * , \** and the print() statement upon the Complex class.
 3. Create a second class PolarComplexNumber, that inherits the Complex class and creates a complex polar number. This is called Inheritance
 5. Make a plot with matplotlib using your complex class, make an x range from -2 to 2. Then have y(x) = (x + xj)^3. Plot the imaginary and real parts with matplotlib on the same plot.
 6. Make contour plots of f(z) = z^2 where z = x+yj
  - It is a contour plot, so the color is the value of f, the x axis is real part x and y axis is the imaginary part.
  - Two plots:
    - The first plot where f is the magnitude of f(z).
    - The second plot where f is the phase of f(z).

 7. (Extra Optional) Make your complex Class a library
